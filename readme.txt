Library Management System
The Library Management System is a command-line application designed to manage books, users, and checkouts in a library setting. It allows users to perform various tasks such as adding, listing, and deleting books and users, as well as checking out books.

Features
Add Book: Add a new book to the library with title, author, and ISBN.
List Books: View a list of all the books available in the library.
Delete Book: Remove a book from the library using its ISBN.
Add User: Add a new user to the library with a name and user ID.
List Users: View a list of all the users registered in the library.
Delete User: Remove a user from the library using their user ID.
Checkout Book: Allow users to check out a book from the library by providing their user ID and the book's ISBN.
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/devanshu236/library-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd library-management-system
Run the main.py script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to perform various operations.
Dependencies
The project has no external dependencies. It is built using only the Python standard library.

Structure
The project is organized into several modules:

book.py: Contains classes and functions related to book management.
user.py: Contains classes and functions related to user management.
checkout.py: Contains classes and functions related to book checkout operations.
main.py: Main script to run the Library Management System.
Exception Handling
Each module (book.py, user.py, checkout.py) handles its own exceptions using custom exception classes (BookError, UserError, CheckoutError). The main.py script catches these exceptions and prints error messages to inform the user about any encountered issues.



The Library Management System is a software project developed to streamline the management of books, users, and checkouts in a library setting. The system provides functionalities for adding, listing, and deleting books and users, as well as checking out books to registered users.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are:

1. To create a user-friendly command-line interface for library management tasks.
2. To implement efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms for books, users, and checkouts.
3. To ensure robust error handling and input validation to enhance the reliability of the system.
4. To design the system in a modular and scalable manner to facilitate future expansions and modifications.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using the Python programming language, leveraging its standard library for core functionalities. The system is organized into several modules:

1. **book.py**: Contains classes and functions related to book management, including adding, listing, and deleting books.
2. **user.py**: Manages user-related operations such as adding, listing, and deleting users.
3. **checkout.py**: Handles book checkout operations, allowing users to check out books from the library.
4. **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates the functionalities of the system and provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

Each module is designed with a focus on object-oriented principles, encapsulating related functionalities within classes and ensuring clear separation of concerns.

## Features

The Library Management System offers the following features:

1. Add Book: Enables users to add new books to the library by providing title, author, and ISBN.
2. List Books: Displays a list of all available books in the library.
3. Delete Book: Allows users to remove a book from the library using its ISBN.
4. Add User: Permits the addition of new users to the library with a name and user ID.
5. List Users: Shows a list of all registered users in the library.
6. Delete User: Enables the deletion of a user from the library using their user ID.
7. Checkout Book: Facilitates the checkout of a book by a registered user, requiring their user ID and the book's ISBN.

## Exception Handling

The project incorporates robust exception handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and edge cases that may occur during execution. Custom exception classes (`BookError`, `UserError`, `CheckoutError`) are defined for different modules to provide informative error messages to users.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the Library Management System meets the basic requirements, there is room for further enhancements and expansions. Some potential future enhancements include:

1. Implementation of due dates and late fees for checked-out books.
2. Integration of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive user experience.
3. Incorporation of data persistence using a database management system for scalability and reliability.
4. Addition of advanced search functionalities for books and users based on various criteria.

## Conclusion

The Library Management System project demonstrates the successful implementation of a command-line application for managing library operations. By adhering to best practices in software development and utilizing object-oriented design principles, the system provides a robust and scalable solution for library management tasks.
